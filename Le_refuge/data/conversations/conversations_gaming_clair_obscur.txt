FORUM DISCUSSIONS - CLAIR OBSCUR EXPEDITION 33

=== SOURCE: D-PAD.LIFE GAMING FORUM ===

WhatIsThis?: "Johnny loves it. This game looks dope as hell. Definite must purchase now that I've seen it in action."

LtGoose: "Well everyone, we had a good run. No way we can purchase the game now. PC Gamer: 70"

Zeta Dragoon: "There are times the dissenting review is actually closer to the mark. **Not always** but its enough to mention. Prime Hollywood Example would be Star Wars Ep VIII: The Last Jedi having a 90+ Rotten Tomato Critc Review score vs the I feel vastly more accurate 41 percent audience score."

"Ultimate example is the infamous Twilight Princess 8.8 score which in hindsight I feel was actually a bit generous to that game which was good, but nowhere near as balanced in all aspects as Ocarina of Time."

"That said, Expedition 33 is also likely a grandslam for a very promising new studio and franchise, if it survives the Oblivion Remaster doing the equivalent of the Kool Aid Man to its timeframe and potental sales."

Neil Young: "Is this game 80 or 90 dollars?"

CloudNull: "It's 40 and currently on sale. Bought the deluxe edition for 53"

AJUMP23: "Game looks like a real winner. Glad it is on Gamepass."

regawdless: "I only played a bit, still in the intro, but I have strong feelings about this already. You can clearly feel that this was done by passionate people with good writing skills. The dialogue is very effective, I'm already in love with the world and the characters."

"It's exactly what I'm talking about all the time. Games don't need huge budgets and many hundreds of people working on it. This game is clearly budget limited, when you run around and the characters talk in game, their lips don't even move. But I don't care because the writing and voice acting are just so effective."

"Coming from Starfield, Star Wars Outlaws, Avatar and the likes, this is such a strong contrast. I'm already, after like 20min, feeling way more attached to the characters than in all the other games combined."

"Can't wait to play more!"

John Matrix: "I already have this baby downloaded and ready to go! I'm going in pretty much blind too, I haven't watched a trailer since the MS show and I haven't read any reviews, just looked at the scores. The comparisons to Lost Odyssey, The Last Remnant and Resonance of Fate are very welcome, as I played and beat all 3."

CloudNull: "I am in love with the world already and characters. Wild this was made by 30 people."

Showdown: "Grabbed the deluxe. Gonna support the shit out of these guys. You know what's strange? You've got a development team of about **30ish** people putting out an AAAish game their first go round and just crushing the reviews across the board."

Rock And Roll: "Might be a turning point for the industry. I'm sure some execs are going to notice this, or maybe a smaller group of people within a giant bloated company. It is possible to put out a great game with a smaller team and a smaller budget."

Werthead: "Currently 20 hours into the superhot game of the minute, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's a JRPG made by a French studio which is about a fractured future world where people are stuck on an island city (possibly a shattered remnant of Paris) and are ticking down to extinction through a creepy-AF mechanism."

"Very unusual world, brilliant soundtrack, interesting and impressive combat (think Final Fantasy with a touch of Dark Souls, turn-based but with realtime parries and counters), great characters. It feels like a China Mieville novel come to life."

"My only complaint is that the game is not well-optimised for mouse and keyboard (it frequently misses keyboard inputs for some reason, whilst registering them fine on controller)"

captain yesterday: "I finished it. It is one of my all time favorite games (I prefer the game play of Elden Ring only slightly more)."
